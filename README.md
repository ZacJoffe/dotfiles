# Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for my Arch Linux install on my desktop.

I've set everything up to be simple, aesthetically pleasing, and efficient for my workflow.

## About current setup

Here's a list of the programs I'm using:
- Terminal: Alacritty
- Window Manager: bspwm
- Hotkey Daemon: sxhkd
- IDE: Visual Studio Code [Settings](https://gist.github.com/ZacJoffe/1417ebed26108060fcdefd6b1e4895ed)
- Text Editor: Neovim
- Bar: Polybar
- Launcher: Rofi
- Compositor: Compton
- Notification Daemon: Dunst
- Shell: Fish
- Misc:
  - Redshift
  - Feh
  - Zathura

Everything is riced to match the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) dark colour scheme (it was previously themed with purple).
