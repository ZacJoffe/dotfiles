# Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for my Arch Linux install on my desktop. Currently I'm using bspwm, but plan to try out a dynamic window manager in the near future.  

I've set everything up to be simple, aesthetically pleasing, and efficient for my workflow.

## About current setup

Here's a list of the programs I'm using:
- Terminal: Alacritty
- Window Manager: bspwm
- Hotkey Daemon: sxhkd
- Text Editor: Neovim
- Bar: Polybar
- Launcher: Rofi
- Compositor: Compton
- Notification Daemon: Dunst
- Shell: Fish
- Misc:
  - Redshift
  - Feh
  - Zathura
