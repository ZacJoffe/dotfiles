# Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for my Arch Linux install on my desktop.

Previously, the rice was inspired by the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) dark colour scheme. As of right now, everything is riced with the colour schemes generated by Pywal every time my desktop is started.

Everything is riced to match the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) dark colour scheme (it was previously themed with purple).
