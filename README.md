# Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for my Arch Linux install on my desktop.

I've set everything up to be simple, aesthetically pleasing, and efficient for my workflow.

Previously, the rice was inspired by the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) dark colour scheme. As of right now, everything is riced with the colour schemes generated by Pywal every time my desktop is started and a new random background is selected.

I do my best to keep this repository up to date with any changes to my configs.
